# Robot-Car-PID-Web-Control-Visual-Odometry-
Designed and implemented a self-driving robot car integrating PID motor control with encoders, an ESP32-based web interface for manual driving, and a Python visual odometry system using OpenCV to track trajectory and send navigation commands. The system allows both remote manual control and semi-autonomous navigation, showcasing advanced robotics.
